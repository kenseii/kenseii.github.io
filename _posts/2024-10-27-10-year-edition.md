# 10 Year edition

2 weeks ago i crossed 10 years getting paid to break things on the internet. Quite a journey it was. I still remember the beginnings, countless days spent in kLab and Impact hub Kigali fighting with php in a corner that had a mixed smell of coffee and dirty dishes.

Back then i had no idea what a crazy journey it was going to be or even how many passionate engineers, makers and entrepreneurs i would meet on the way. I got to work for companies, start some and serve clients on 3 continents but the thing i remember the most is the fun i got from it and the cool people i worked with along the way.

If i had a message to give to myself ten years back (or even today), it would be this:


_Be patient with yourself young padawan. However don't underestimate your potential, you are the closest living thing to John Rambo... You just don't know it yet_

Normally i would do some shoutouts to people who helped me in the journey but... privacy.




To more 10 years like these.
