YO :-)

I currently work on backend and cloud (mainly AWS) services used to process and store various data coming from computer vision models running on edge devices.

2019, 2020 and 2021 i was working on location/mapping related solutions combining open source GIS, Cloud(GCP/AWS) and software development.

Before that I worked on open source ERP(Odoo, ERPnext) implementation projects for African and European institutions.
