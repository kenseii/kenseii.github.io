<div class="intro">  
My SEO settings aren't that great so if you are here you probably know my name ;-)
<br>
I spend my days working in tech and evenings practicing martial arts.
<br>
<br>
The reason this web exist is so that i can have a place to publish some notes on things i am working on or learning and maybe... market my skills/solutions. Having that said i might write about non-tech related topics once in a while.
<br>
<br>
Untill next time, wear a mask.
